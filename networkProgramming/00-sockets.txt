Sockets
Unix programs do any sort of I/O by reading or writing to a file descriptor.
A file descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file.
When you want to communicate with another program over the Internet you're
gonna do it through a file descriptor.
You make a call to the socket() sysem routine. It returns the socket 
descriptor, and you communicate through it using the specialized send() 
and recv() socket calls.

There are two types of Internet sockets:
1.Stream Socket ("SOCK_STREAM")
2.Datagram Socket ("SOCK_DGRAM") - "connectionless socket"

Stream sockets are reliable two-way connected communication streams.
Browsers use HTTP wich uses stream sockets to get pages.

With datagram sockets you don't have to maintaion an open connection as you
do with stream sockets. You just build a packet, slap IP header on it with
destination information, and send it out. No connection needed.

Stream sockets uses TCP.
Datagram sockets uses UDP.
